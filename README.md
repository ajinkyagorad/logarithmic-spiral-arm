# Logarithmic Spiral Arm 

Based on the work in Wang, Zhanchi, Nikolaos M. Freris, and Xi Wei. "SpiRobs: Logarithmic spiral-shaped robots for versatile grasping across scales." Device (2024).
This repository contains a Fusion 360 script for generating a profile for aiding in the design of a logarithmic spiral arm profile based on specified parameters in the script.

## Usage
1. Run the provided Fusion 360 script to generate the initial logarithmic spiral arm profile.
2. After running the script, **manual adjustments** are needed to complete the design.
3. The final design can be exported as an STL file for 3D printing or further modifications.
4. A Fusion 360 `.f3d` file is provided.

**Note:** This project is based on the given information and does not fully describe the entire arm.

## Embedded STL
For convenience, a pre-generated **cylindrical spiral arm** STL file is included in the repository:

## Notes
- Ensure that units are set to **millimeters (mm)** in Fusion 360 before running the script.
- Manual modifications might be needed for alignment and structural optimizations.
