# Logarithmic Spiral Arm Generation
Based on the idea presented in Wang, Zhanchi, Nikolaos M. Freris, and Xi Wei. "SpiRobs: Logarithmic spiral-shaped robots for versatile grasping across scales." Device (2024).
This repository contains a Fusion 360 script for generating a profilefor aiding in design of logarithmic spiral arm profile based on specified parameters in the script.

## Usage
1. Run the provided Fusion 360 script to generate the initial logarithmic spiral arm profile.
2. After running the script, **manual adjustments** to complete the design. 
3. The final design can be exported as an STL file for 3D printing or further modifications.
4. Fusion360 f3d file is provided.

Note. project is based on the given information, and does not articulately describe the entire arm

## Embedded STL
For convenience, a pre-generated **cylindrical spiral arm** STL file is included in the repository:

![Logarithmic Spiral Arm](cylindrical_spiral_arm.stl)

## Notes
- Ensure that units are set to **millimeters (mm)** in Fusion 360 before running the script.
- Manual modifications might be needed for alignment and structural optimizations.
